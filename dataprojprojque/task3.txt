Experimental Setup:

Select a suitable small object detection model, such as YOLOv3 or YOLOv5.
Prepare a dataset consisting of images with individuals in an industrial site.
Annotate the dataset with ground truth bounding boxes for the individuals.
Split the dataset into a training set and a test set.
Model Training:

Train the small object detection model on the annotated training set using the chosen technique, such as higher input resolution or data augmentation.
Fine-tune the model on the training set for better performance on small objects.
Monitor the training progress by tracking metrics like loss, precision, and recall.
Model Evaluation:

Evaluate the model's performance on the test set by measuring accuracy and precision.
Compute accuracy as the ratio of correctly detected individuals to the total number of individuals.
Calculate precision as the ratio of true positive detections to the sum of true positive and false positive detections.
Use evaluation metrics specific to your model, such as mean Average Precision (mAP) for object detection.
Compare Results:

Compare the accuracy and precision of the model before and after the implementation of the chosen technique.
Analyze the results to determine the impact of the technique on the model's performance.
Consider any improvements or changes in accuracy and precision, as well as potential limitations or challenges.
Visualizations:

Generate visualizations of the detected individuals in the images.
Plot bounding boxes and labels on sample images to illustrate the model's performance.
Show images with both correct and incorrect detections to provide a comprehensive view.
Report:

Write a report summarizing the experimental setup, including the chosen technique and dataset details.
Present the accuracy and precision results before and after the implementation of the technique.
Discuss the impact of the chosen technique on the model's performance.
Include visualizations to support your analysis and demonstrate the model's detection capabilities.
